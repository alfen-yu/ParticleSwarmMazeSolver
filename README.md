# Solving a random maze using Particle Swarm Optimization Method 
 ParticleMazeSolver is a repository dedicated to solving mazes using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of swarms, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish, to efficiently search for optimal solutions. In this project, we implement PSO to navigate through mazes, optimizing the pathfinding process. The repository provides a customizable and efficient solution for solving mazes of varying complexities, offering insights into PSO-based optimization techniques applied to maze solving. This code was submitted for the course assignment Computational Intelligence CS-451 offered at Habib University.
